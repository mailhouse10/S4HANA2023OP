This Utility Program is created to Migrate 1 Material from a Source System to Target System using the V2 OData API_PRODUCT_SRV. The objective of this utility is to help the development & functional teams in Unit Testing by creating the Material Master Data in Development system from a source system(ex: Quality/Pre Prod/Prod). Yes, there would be quite a number of prerequisites around other related master data/configuration data, however with this you will have a chance to test the developments with real time data before moving to Quality/Pre Prod.
